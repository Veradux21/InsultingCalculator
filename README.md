# InsultingCalculator

## Purpose
This is a proof of concept for my ability to create a calculator webapp built in HTML, JS.

The target is to allow a user to do basic calculations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with multiple calculations.

As an added bonus, I've also decided to make the UI deliver an insult every time the user runs a calculation.
